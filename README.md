## 👥 Our Team
| Name | Role | Main Work |
|------|------|------------|
| **Ahmed Hassan** | Invader AI & Game Logic | Made the invaders move, attack, and get faster as they’re destroyed. |
| **Ayan Hassan** | Player Controls & Lives | Built the player’s movement, shooting system, and life/respawn logic. |
| **Abdul Hadi** | Barrier System & Graphics | Created destructible barriers and handled visuals and rendering. |

## 🧩 Project Overview
We built a Python version of the classic **Space Invaders** game using **PyGame**.  
Our goal was to recreate the main gameplay features while showing how programming concepts like **OOP**, **events**, and **collisions** work together in a real game.

The player moves left and right, shooting at waves of invaders that move across the screen and fire back.  
Barriers give temporary cover but break down when hit by bullets.  
The game includes sound, music, and a scoring system.

## 🚀 Features
- Player with **3 lives** and continuous shooting  
- **Invaders** that move, shoot randomly, and speed up over time  
- **Destructible barriers** that break apart when hit  
- **Background image and music** for an arcade feel  
- **Score system** and win/lose screens

## 🧍 What Each of Us Did

### 🧑‍💻 Ahmed Hassan – Invader AI
- Made all the invaders move horizontally.  
- Added random enemy bullet firing.  
- Made invaders speed up as their numbers go down.  
- Handled bullet collisions and enemy removal.

**Concepts Used:** Classes, lists, game loops, and difficulty scaling.


### 🎮 Ayan Hassan – Player System
- Built the player movement and shooting.  
- Added a shooting cooldown so bullets don’t spam.  
- Set up a 3-life system with respawn after death.  
- Handled collisions with enemy bullets.

**Concepts Used:** Event handling, OOP, state management, and collisions.

### 🧱 Abdul Hadi – Barriers & Rendering
- Created destructible barriers using a small 2D grid.  
- Made each section disappear when hit by a bullet.  
- Used transparency to make barriers look smooth.  
- Optimized rendering for better game performance.

**Concepts Used:** 2D lists, rendering, alpha blending, and game physics.
